# Data Mining Programming Assignment - 2

## Overview

This project is a Data Mining assignment focused on building a machine learning model to classify NBA players' positions based on their performance statistics. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, handling class imbalance, training a model, and evaluating its performance using various metrics.

## Files

- `Project2.py`: The main script that contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- `nba2021.csv`: The dataset containing NBA players' statistics for the 2021 season. Ensure this file is placed in the same directory as the script.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
